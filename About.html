                    Book Search works just like web search. Try a search on The E-Books Garden or on YEBG.com.
                    When we find a book with content that contains a match for your search terms, we'll
                    link to it in your search results.

                    If the book is out of copyright, or the publisher has given us permission, you'll be
                    able to see a preview of the book, and in some cases the entire text. If it's in the
                    public domain, you're free to download a PDF copy.
